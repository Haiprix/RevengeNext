/**
 * Why an activity is (not) reaching the user's profile.
 *
 * `SelfPresenceStore.shouldShowActivity` filters every local activity before it
 * is published, and for a `PLAYING` activity it delegates to
 * `shouldShareApplicationActivity` in `utils/LibraryApplicationUtils.tsx`:
 *
 *   return ShowCurrentGame.getSetting()
 *     && StatusSetting.getSetting() !== Constants.INVISIBLE
 *     && (app == null || !app.hasFlag(Constants.PRIVATE))
 *
 * The first condition is the "Share my activity" toggle. With it off the client
 * keeps accepting `SET_ACTIVITY` and keeps reporting success — the activity is
 * filtered out of the presence, nothing appears on the profile, and no error is
 * surfaced anywhere. And because `LocalActivityStore` only recomputes when the
 * activity *changes*, turning the setting back on does not re-publish what is
 * already stored: the payload has to be re-sent.
 *
 * Only that first condition is checked here. `INVISIBLE` and `PRIVATE` are
 * minified onto different require results in the client, so they cannot be
 * resolved reliably; guessing them would risk nagging about a condition that is
 * not actually the problem. When the toggle is on we therefore stay quiet.
 */

/**
 * `ShowCurrentGame` is a genuine, non-minified export of `modules/user_settings/
 * UserSettings`, and that module is initialised by the core client long before

 *
 * Both setting names are listed deliberately: on-device a single-prop
 * `withProps('ShowCurrentGame')` matched nothing, while the two-prop form
 * resolved the module and read `showCurrentGame`/`status` back correctly. The
 * lookup is therefore done by the pair that is known to work, with the
 * single-prop form kept only as a fallback.
